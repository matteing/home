excerpt: "Today is one of those days."
---

I’m sitting in my bed, laptop in lap, trying to figure out the words to describe how I feel at the moment.

Quite frankly, I had a shit day. I thought too much, I did too little. My brain feels exhausted and low on energy.

**It’s one of those days for me.** The days where you just sit and wonder whether you’re doing the right thing, chasing the right dreams, and having the right ideas.

Today is one of the days when I wonder if I will fail. The days that I worry endlessly about what the future holds. The days of soul-crushing self doubt.

I don’t usually feel like this. I’m energetic and optimistic by nature. But every once in a while, my brain ceases to function and moves from the present to the future.

However, even when self doubt comes creeping in, something remains: I always stay confident about my ability to deal with whatever shit life throws at me. I don’t know if I will fail or succeed, but whatever happens, I’ll be fine. I’ll keep walking.

“I usually figure shit out” is a common phrase for me. So yes, I’ve had one of “those days” today. But I know it’s going to be alright.

  This is pretty nonsensical, I know. But it makes sense to me, and I guess
  that’s the point of a journal, no?
