excerpt: "Choice drives us insane."

A couple of years back I read [this amazing book by Peter Shankman](https://www.amazon.com/Faster-Than-Normal-Turbocharge-Productivity/dp/0143131222) on productivity for people with ADHD. One of the best takeaways? To reduce choice.

Choice drives us insane. Analysis paralysis can cause microseconds, hours or even days of inaction — wasting valuable time. Most of the time, the choices we worry about don’t deserve our time and energy.

Don’t have a huge wardrobe. Don’t overthink your developer stack choices. Have a routine that doesn’t limit you but doesn’t allow too much flexibility. Use highly opinionated software and prefer convention over configuration.

Just reduce choice. Live a limited, minimalist life that allows you to shave these minutes and focus on the things that matter most.
