- **The Rings:** Logs are a common building material for cabins. The rings represent “age rings” of trees, symbolizing growth and resilience.
- **The Triangle:** The triangle is shaped as the roof of a cabin. A cabin is a quiet, private, lovely place. A cabin is where people get together to shelter from the elements in safety and comfort.
- **The Log:** The logo is shaped as a circle (a wood log). It’s also a bit of a homage to Makerlog, where Cabin started.

Cabin is about comfort, unity and lasting relationships.

_Unitatis perpetuum, amici._
