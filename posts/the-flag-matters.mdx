If there’s something I never forget when building new products, it’s the Puerto Rican flag in the footer.

**To me, placing the flag isn’t just a trendy thing to do. It’s a commitment. It imposes a duty to create software to be proud of.**

If you build awful or half-baked software, you’re doing a disservice to that flag. You’re not giving it your all — misrepresenting our little island on the world stage.

That flag at the bottom of your website: that’s the people you represent. Wave it proudly and build things people love to use.

  <strong>The cover image:</strong> There’s this sticker from Puerto Rican
  company Salón Boricua I absolutely love. It’s an astronaut flying the Puerto
  Rican flag. I think it really embodies what it means to be a tech entrepreneur
  representing this tiny patch of Earth we’re all so grateful to be born in.
