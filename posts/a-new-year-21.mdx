<p>2021.</p>

**It’s going to be a year of exploration.** Exploring myself, exploring those close to me, exploring my surroundings.

**It’s going to be a year of love.** A year of loving those around me, loving nature, and — most importantly — loving myself.

**It’s going to be a year of learning.** Learning about my craft, learning about the world, and learning from my mistakes.

**It’s going to be a year of hard work.** Working hard towards my goals and ambitions, working hard towards finding myself, and working hard towards improving my skills.

**It’s going to be a year of leadership.** Leading my team, leading a community, and leading myself.

**It’s going to be a year of confidence.** Confidence in myself, confidence in the path I take, and confidence in those around me.

**It’s going to be a year of balance.** Balance between my work and play, balance in my emotions, and balance between risk and certainty.

**It’s going to be a year of strength.** Strength to tackle new problems, strength to improve myself, and strength to walk into unknown territory.

It’s, put simply, going to be a great year — for myself and those around me. Time to kick ass.
