excerpt: "Don’t take your workouts so seriously."

Don’t take your workouts so seriously. They’re just meant to get you off your ass and pumping some blood.

If you want to start dancing to some hype song in the middle of it and waste 7 minutes, feel free.

Just do whatever moves you. Workouts should be fun, not torture. Don’t take yourself so seriously.

Work out and have fun while you’re at it.

_Written after spending 10 minutes dancing to total hype during a workout._
