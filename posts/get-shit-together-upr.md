I will forever bitch and whine about this: why do we need to use so many different platforms for remote learning?

I'm starting to feel like keeping up with each of my classes is a full-time job in itself in this remote age.

Professors, do we REALLY need to use all this software to post our daily assignments? For only THREE classes this semester, I need to check each of these daily:

- Moodle
- Google Classroom
- Piazza
- E-mail
- Datacamp

Is this a fucking joke? Honestly? 

People have lives, side-jobs, stuff to do. Centralize your shit. Cut the inefficiency and bullshit.

USE. ONE. PLATFORM.
