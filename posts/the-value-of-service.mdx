Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about the value of service. Curiously, the more I think about it, the more I realize that service is the answer and solution to many obstacles in life.

**Sales:** Sales is about service. It’s about solving someone’s problem with your product, providing support and caring about the client needs. Sales is making sure your client reaches their goals with your product and expertise.

**Community:** Building a community is about service. It’s about understanding the members of your community, understanding their ambitions and helping them reach their goals. It’s about putting humans before your business goals. To provide value and to serve are the core activities of a community leader.

**Life:** Life is about service. The most wholesome and satisfying act one can do is to serve others.

Serve passionately. You’ll be surprised at how far it takes you.
