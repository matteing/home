excerpt: "I'm a bit of a dreamer, but there's a reason why."

**I do it for my mom.** Because she doesn’t deserve working every single waking moment of her life. [Because she never deserved the Puerto Rican government stealing away her retirement.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210112015254/https://www.primerahora.com/noticias/gobierno-politica/notas/entre-abucheos-reclamos-y-llantos-la-aprobacion-de-la-reforma-video/) Because she worked so, so hard to give me a great education.

**I do it for my dad.** Because I inherited his entrepreneurial blood. Because I know he’s proud of everything I do, for everything I have and will become. Because he taught me how the world works — and never hid its complexity nor nuance, even when I couldn’t understand it.

**I do it for my grandparents.** Because I want them to see me graduate and become a successful entrepreneur. Because I want them to make them proud in the little time I have left with them.

**I do it for my future family.** Because I remember how difficult it was when my family went bankrupt. Because I remember those difficult conversations and being afraid of coming home to nothing left.

**I do it for myself.** Because I can never stay still. Because I enjoy a great challenge. Because I never want to be a cog in the system.

**I do it because I want to ding the universe.** Because I don’t want to die without leaving my small dent in this huge, huge thing called the Universe. [And, of course, because I can.](https://youtu.be/kYfNvmF0Bqw?t=14)

That’s why I do it.
