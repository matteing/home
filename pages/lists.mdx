### What is this?

I like to write lists as a less formal way of expressing my ideas on many subjects without pressure of extensive writing.

This list of lists is an endless work in progress, so come back to check frequently.

### Books

- [The Last Empire: The Final Days of the Soviet Union](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Empire-Final-Soviet-Union/dp/0465046711)
  - Little known secret about me: I'm a huge history nerd.
  - I don't believe in Marxist ideas, but learning about societies inspired by those ideas is very interesting to me.
  - I figure that learning about systems and ideas so different to the ones I am exposed to daily is just very fascinating to me.
  - I have a particular interest in the Soviet Union for some reason. I guess it's just interesting to me how a superpower can collapse from one year to the next.
- [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382)

      - From: [Toda generación tiene su ilusión juvenil y su desencanto, según Joaquín Sabina (Every generation has its youthful illusions and a disappontment)](https://www.efe.com/efe/america/gente/toda-generacion-tiene-su-ilusion-juvenil-y-desencanto-segun-joaquin-sabina/20000014-3352699)

### Life
- The best thing one can do to be less shy is to... start waving and smiling.
  - I've started waving at people from my car. I don't even know them.

### Productivity

- You do you.
  - I'm a strong believer in "you do you" for personal productivity.
    - There is no recipe, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
      - If waking up early works for you, fine.
      - If staying up late is your jam, whatever rocks your boat.
      - If going on unorganized, unstructured work sprints gets you shipping, that's great.
      - If building structured plans and accounting for every minute gets you productive, that's great too.
    - It's all about you and screw whatever others think.
  - Don't listen to how I work: Find whatever works for you.
- Due to my ADHD, my "focus" is very unstructured.
  - I have extremely high-output, laser-focused weeks.
    - These weeks, I obsess _hard_ over whatever I'm building.
    - I literally can't stop thinking for a moment about what I'm doing.
  - I have low-output, unfocused weeks.
    - These weeks, I can't point my brain anywhere.

### Dating

- Make me a playlist.
  - Music is my love language.
- Let's go roadtripping.
  - None of that restaurant or movies stuff, let's go on an all-day adventure.
  - The best way to bond with someone is through shared memories in nature.
- You pay for your stuff and I pay for my stuff.
  - If we're going on a date, you're buying your own lunch and I'll pay mine. If we're both using a service, we split the bill.
  - Every once in a while, I'll buy you stuff or pay for a lunch: I'm not a bad partner either.
  - I believe that in a strong relationship both folks should be financially independent.

### Quotes

- "Your happiness is intertwined with your outlook on life."
