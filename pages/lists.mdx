### What is this?

I like to write lists as a less formal way of expressing my ideas on many subjects without pressure of extensive writing.

### Life
- The best thing one can do to be less shy is to... start waving and smiling.
  - I've started waving at people from my car. I don't even know them.

### Goals
- I'm building the first Puerto Rican unicorn. 
  - It's forever been my dream. 
  - I'm not fucking around. It's getting done. 

### Productivity

- You do you.
  - I'm a strong believer in "you do you" for personal productivity.
    - There is no recipe, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
      - If waking up early works for you, fine.
      - If staying up late is your jam, whatever rocks your boat.
      - If going on unorganized, unstructured work sprints gets you shipping, that's great.
      - If building structured plans and accounting for every minute gets you productive, that's great too.
    - It's all about you and screw whatever others think.
  - Don't listen to how I work: Find whatever works for you.
- Due to my ADHD, my "focus" is very unstructured.
  - I have extremely high-output, laser-focused weeks.
    - These weeks, I obsess _hard_ over whatever I'm building.
    - I literally can't stop thinking for a moment about what I'm doing.
  - I have low-output, unfocused weeks.
    - These weeks, I can't point my brain anywhere.

### Dating

- Make me a playlist.
  - Music is my love language.
- Let's go roadtripping.
  - None of that restaurant or movies stuff, let's go on an all-day adventure.
  - The best way to bond with someone is through shared memories in nature.
- You pay for your stuff and I pay for my stuff.
  - If we're going on a date, you're buying your own lunch and I'll pay mine. If we're both using a service, we split the bill.
  - Every once in a while, I'll buy you stuff or pay for a lunch: I'm not a bad partner either.
  - I believe that in a strong relationship both folks should be financially independent.

### Quotes

- "Your happiness is intertwined with your outlook on life."
- "Think bigger."
- "The one thing I dread is that my talks should be so frequent as to lose their effectiveness. ... Every time I talk over the air it means four or five days of long, overtime work in the preparation of what I say. Actually, I cannot afford to take this time away from more vital things. I think we must avoid too much personal leadership—my good friend Winston Churchill has suffered a little from this."
  - FDR when asked about the possibility of hosting weekly "Fireside Chats" on radio
