### What is this?

I like to write lists as a less formal way of expressing my ideas on many subjects without pressure of extensive writing.

This list of lists is an endless work in progress, so come back to check frequently.

### Books

- [The Last Empire: The Final Days of the Soviet Union](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Empire-Final-Soviet-Union/dp/0465046711)
  - Little known secret about me: I'm a huge history nerd.
  - I don't believe in Marxist ideas, but learning about societies inspired by those ideas is very interesting to me.
  - I figure that learning about systems and ideas so different to the ones I am exposed to daily is just very fascinating to me.
  - I have a particular interest in the Soviet Union for some reason. I guess it's just interesting to me how a superpower can collapse from one year to the next.
- [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382)
  - This is a time-management bible for folks who want to reach their goals.
  - Thanks JC for forever impacting my life with this book rec.
  - Do less, but better.

### Music

- [My Life Mixtape](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Pt9dnYstk7x8NcqTZJ00V?si=zMOV0dYIRmqThhKWhCJs7Q)
  - Put simply, every song in this playlist has significant personal meaning.
  - Name me a song in this playlist and I can tell you exactly the memory it brings back.
- [Pink Salt](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5IFuhe27O3R1SMzh9BBuax?si=uIfstiDaSMacnjJVMzvmEA)
  - Quite possibly the saddest playlist I've ever made.
  - Got me through some stuff early 2020...
- [Luna (Live), Zoé](https://open.spotify.com/track/7b3k8I1fncAzbk9PHnLkbX?si=ETfqXna-QO2OCXqvsf8ciQ)
  - One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, right up there with [Eclipse by Natalia Lafourcade](https://open.spotify.com/track/3gEQc4TtNyDxkwhQhLQTuw?si=my2__Lr2S6e5WfbIqHp-jw).
- [Green Eyes, Uncle Chris](https://open.spotify.com/track/31WU1s85w50W8gWzkP6Qmz?si=bUEuqSasQ_6MoRhfX-lx9w)
  - Someone dedicated this song to me and I still think that it's the most charming thing that anyone has done for me.
  
### Dating

- I'm a strong believer in "you pay for your stuff, I pay for my stuff".
  - If we're going on a date, you're buying your own lunch and I'll pay mine. If we're both using a service, we split the bill.
  - Every once in a while, I'll buy my partner stuff or pay for a lunch though: it doesn't mean "be a bad partner".
  - I believe in a strong relationship, both folks should be financially independent.

### Quotes

- "Your happiness is intertwined with your outlook on life."
- "Déjenme llorar..." — [Carla Morrison](https://open.spotify.com/track/61paDgouceUmuVTsoUO5TD?si=qmOWfeGKTq2PmiFhPJMJPw)
